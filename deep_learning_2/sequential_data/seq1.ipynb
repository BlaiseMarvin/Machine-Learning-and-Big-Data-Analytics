    "- what makes sequences unique is that compared to other types of data, elements in a sequence appear in a certain order and are not independent of each other. Typical ML algorithms for supervised learning assume that the input is **independent and identically distributed (IID)** data, which means that training examples are mutually independent and have the same underlying distribution.

    "**The different categories of sequence modelling:**\n",
    "- If neither the input nor output data represent sequences, then we are dealing with standard data, and we could simply use a multilayer perceptron to model such data. However if either the input or the output is a sequence, the modelling task likely falls into one of these categories:\n",
    "   - **Many-to-one:** The input data is a sequence, but the output is a fixed-size vector or a scalar, not a sequence. For example, in sentiment analysis, the input is text-based (for example a movie review), and the output is a class label (for example, a label denoting whether a reviewer liked the movie)\n",
    "   - **One-to-many:** The input data is in standard format and not a sequence, but the output is a sequence. An example of this category is image captioning - the input is an image and the output is an english phrase summarizing the content of that image\n",
    "   - **Many-to-many:** Both the input and output arrays are sequences. This category can be further divided based on whether the input and output are synchronized. An example of a synchronized many-to-many task is video classification, where each frame in a video is labeled. An example of a delayed many-to-many modeling task would be translating one language to another. for instance, an entire english sentence must be read and processed by a machine before its translation to german is produced."
